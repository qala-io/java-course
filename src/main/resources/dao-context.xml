        <!--Starting from Java6 and introduction of JDBC4 driver it's not necessary anymore to load the JDBC Drivers
        manually - they will be detected via SPI (service provider interface) which is going to scan classpath, find
        all the files `META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver` and then ask each driver if the URL matches its expectations.
        The one that says "yes" is used to connect to DB. More info: http://www.onjava.com/2006/08/02/jjdbc-4-enhancements-in-java-se-6.html
        But this mechanism is broken for App Servers since the scanning happens only once - and that probably is done
        when the App Server itself is started - not when the app is deployed. This is an issue if the driver is located
        within the WAR file itself (not if it's in TOMCAT/lib). More info:

         - DB Server was down for some time and it doesn't know anymore about our client connections
         - Firewall between our app and the DB server decided that it should drop/reject packages going forward because
         of inactivity or because of misconfiguration

         When we work with in-memory DBs this is probably not important, but usually we work with remote DBs and this
         is a demonstration of DB Pools in action.

        long. This allows the app not to eat all the threads rendering it not working.
        Note, that we can't make this value too low either (e.g. 100ms) because if DB Pool actually needs to go to DB
